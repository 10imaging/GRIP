GRIP (the Graphically Represented Image Processing engine) is a program for rapidly prototyping and deploying computer
vision algorithms, primarily for robotics applications.  **It is currently in a very early state of development**, 
should be ready in time for the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition.

## Running
